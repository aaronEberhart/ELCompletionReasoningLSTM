# PySynGenReas

## main.py

This is a simple Python ER syntax generator and reasoner with room for potential expansion in the future. Has complex logging built in for analysis, so it's not very fast, but it can describe its behavior quite well. There is a plain random generator, as well as a sequential random generator that creates semi-predictable structured patterns with randomness alongside.

## seq2seq.py

This file builds a prediction model of the reasoner with an LSTM. Still in development.
